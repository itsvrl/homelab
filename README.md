# Homelab

```yml
# **What it does**: This repo manages the homelab automaticlly.
# **Why we have it**: We want to make sure that less job is done physiclly and automate everything.
# **Who does it impact**: Everyone interacting with the homelab services.
```

# Basic concept

Using Github repo to configure services and configs. Utilizing Github secrets to store Environment variables and secrets.

Self-hosted Github Runners and with Github Action we can test, validate and integrate the services and configs quickly and repetativly to our environment that is the homelab.

Github Action is responsible for checking if documentation links is out-dated, linting errors and other neat checks that ensures less time having issues with production and in the long run allows for less down-time.
